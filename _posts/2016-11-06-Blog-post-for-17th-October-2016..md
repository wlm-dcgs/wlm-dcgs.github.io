    <td>I learnt that you can use the code to control things like a robot with a moving arm, elbow, wrist, and lights that turn on and off according to the code did actually work.  Different lights would be needed for different things, and code would have to say things like ARMWRIST, ARMELBOW, ARMFINGER, and other parts of the body.  It could be made much easier by copying part of the code because it was practically the same thing repeatedly, so that could be pasted loads.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Because part of it apparently needed lights, I was unsure whether to continue in the manual or not.  I asked whether or not to do it, and the answer was yes.  So we kept on doing it, but because the people next to us had asked the other teacher who had told them not to, we went a bit more slowly, a little bit annoyed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will set up incredibly quickly, so that I can have the maximum possible time to do the coding which I find quite fun anyway. I will try to get the coding correct, so that no time is wasted.  It would be even better if it was done correctly first time so that it gets done even more quickly, because then even more would get done.
