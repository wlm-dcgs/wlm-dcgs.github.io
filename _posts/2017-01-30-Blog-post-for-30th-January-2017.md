How did I learn?   What strategies were effective?</td>

    <td>
To do the code successfully and with ease, there was one very simple and very effective way to do it.  YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  For one of the very simple stages, I didn't read the instructions and I got it wrong.  Then I read the instructions, edited the code, and got it right.  This is what you call an effective strategy.  Today I got completely stuck on a stage.  I did it once.  I got it wrong.  I did it again.  Wrong.  I did it again.  Wrong again.    I did it again.  Wrong again.  I did it again.  Wrong again.  I did it again.  Wrong again.  I did it again.  Wrong again.  I did it again.  Wrong again.  I did it again.  Right!!!!  I simply kept on trying until I got it right.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning?   Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Getting something wrong (I did this!) will always take time, limiting the amount of work you will be able to do.  The time that I took to fix my code was then impossible to use to continue doing the code, limiting how much I could learn.  I need to work on READING THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!*

What will I change for next time?   How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I will make sure that I always read the instructions, and if I still do not get it correct, then will do my best to not use hints.  If somebody else offers me help (them doing it for me themselves) then I will refuse because that is CHEATING and a YELLOW CARD OFFENCE.  Also, if I work harder than I did in today's lesson then I will probably get further and I'll learn more = happy face.  I will make sure I do it myself and next lesson I will get at least 3% further into the coding course.  (It's getting harder)</td>
