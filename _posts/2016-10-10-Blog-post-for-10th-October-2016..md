    <td>I learned how to use more coding commands, and that you use things like x, y, and z very often in code.  The most effective way to learn and do it was to do one section, then swap with my partner, then another section, swap, etc etc etc etc.  This meant that we did quite a lot and I noticed that we were ahead of the pair next to us.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> I was a little bit limited, because I had to go to the speech therapist about my stammer so came in a little bit late, but only by about five minutes, and because part of it apparently needed lights, I was unsure whether to continue in the manual or not.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will get to the lesson on time, so that I can have the maximum possible time to do the coding which I find quite fun anyway, and then set up incredibly quickly but not incorrectly, so that no time is wasted.  It would be even better if it was done even more quickly, because then even more would get done.
