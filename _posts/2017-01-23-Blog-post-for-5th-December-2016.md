You had to think up something good to do, and as the picking up stuff and just putting it down again had already been done, we tried doing something different.  Using a pencil and paper, we controlled the robot arm to pick up the pencil and then bring it down on the paper.  We then controlled the arm to draw what was basically a scribble, but was still a drawing done by it and not us.  This was done repeatedly, and there were soon many .lines on the page.  Having got a bit bored of that, the decision was made to move the robot arm down onto the keyboard to activate something itself.  The robot turned itself off! , This helped me to control the robot arm even better.

For one thing, we could NOT use more than one robot arm, so we could NOT and would NOT have a two way thing.  Also, we were slowed down at first by the fact that we did not yet know quite what to do for the lesson, as about the most simple thing had been done already.

I will come up with ideas before the lesson so that I can then do things without having to think about it first.
