In this lesson we talked about the dangers of sexting and revenge pornography.  We showed other people our articles from our homework last week.  Revenge pornography and sexting are both bad things, and once a text is sent, it is out of your control.  It is a **CRIME** and people at Doctor Challoner's Grammar School have been caught doing it in year 7.
