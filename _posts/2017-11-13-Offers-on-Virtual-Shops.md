Offers on Virtual Shops

In this lesson, we continued with our virtual shops, and things got way more complicated.  The first half hour was spent with me struggling for about twenty minutes and then succeeding in getting the twenty per cent off offer to work.  In the second half of the lesson I decided to try doing an Eat In / Take Away offer with money off for take away or possibly money on for eating in.  I didn't get very far with this, as I spent ages, puzzling over what the code would be and what the offer prices would be etc etc etc, so I didn’t finish.  That’s next lesson!
