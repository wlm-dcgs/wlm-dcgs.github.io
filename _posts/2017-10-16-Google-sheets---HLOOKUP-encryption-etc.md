    <td>I worked out that to make my code work properly I would have to include punctuation, so I made the numbers punctuation on the second row of the keyboard.  This meant that I could type out exactly what I wanted to (HI! I AM BARRY SCOTT!), including punctuation and spaces.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could work out how to create the punctuation above the numbers, and so the numbers as well, but the punctuation on either side of the space bar is harder to work out, as things are used much less (e.g. <>#~| ).  Because of this, including these would probably make it more obvious to find out those encrypted words.</td>

    <td>I was rather slow during this lesson, so I did not succeed in completing decryption so could not proceed onwards after.  I need to be slightly faster in lessons to come, so that I do not fall behind, as falling behind will cause me difficulties in lessons to come.  </td>
