Today I spent about half the lesson simply trying to get passed one stage by the name of 'Mix ‘n Match'.  I repeatedly tried to include two things by the name of Alpha and Bravo, but then about halfway in I went on google images and looked up the exercise.  Just by a quick glance at the blurred picture, I could tell that you did not need Alpha and Bravo in both of them.  I also had forgotten what AND, NOT and OR meant, so looked them up too.
Then I finished the exercise, and carried on………..</td>

Forgetting meanings of words was very unhelpful this lesson, as they were key to the first exercise, and without them you could not do a single thing.  Trying to put something into the code that simply SHOULD NOT be there was also a big mistake, as it always meant that it would not be right.  I think that I should work on remembering a few things so that I don’t have to look them up.</td>

I think I had better work on remembering things.  If I do, then that will be very very very very very very very very very helpful in making the programmer work.  The only problem is ……… I’ve forgotten what they mean already, only 7 hours later!</td>
