Blog Post for 16/06/2016

Creating a micro bit game is a difficult thing, but if you try, it is possible.  I am in a group with Archit, and Kishon, and we are making a game called Blokdrop.  It has four different block types, which drop down the micro bit.  If a row is complete with lights, it deletes itself. You change level if your number of rows deleted is 10.  There are 12 levels, each with a different time limit.  We have 2 weeks and home time to do this.
