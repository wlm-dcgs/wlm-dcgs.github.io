To do the code successfully and with ease, there was one very simple and very effective way to do it.  YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  For one of the very simple stages, I didn't read the instructions and I got it wrong.  Then I read the instructions, edited the code, and got it right.  This is what you call an effective strategy.

Getting something wrong (I did this!) will always take time, limiting the amount of work you will be able to do.  The time that I took to fix my code was then impossible to use to continue doing the code, limiting how much I could learn.

I will make sure that I always read the instructions, and if I still do not get it correct, then will do my best to not use hints.  If somebody else offers me help (them doing it for me themselves) then I will refuse because that is CHEATING and a YELLOW CARD OFFENCE.  Also, if I work harder than I did in today's lesson then I will probably get further and I'll learn more = happy face.
