How did I learn?   What strategies were effective?</td>

    <td>
To do the code successfully and with ease, there was one very simple and very effective way to do it.  YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  For one of the very simple stages, I didn't read the instructions and I got it wrong.  Then I read the instructions, edited the code, and got it right.  This is what you call an effective strategy.

This is exactly the same as what I put least week but due to the fact that we were doing almost exactly the same thing in both lessons I do not know how to make a difference to the code.</td>

    <td>
Getting something wrong (I did this!) will always take time, limiting the amount of work you will be able to do.  The time that I took to fix my code was then impossible to use to continue doing the code, limiting how much I could learn.

This is exactly the same as what I put last week but due to the fact that we were doing almost exactly the same thing in both lessons I don't know how to make a difference to the code.</td>

What will I change for next time?   How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>
I will make sure that I always read the instructions, and if I still do not get it correct, then will do my best to not use hints.  If somebody else offers me help (them doing it for me themselves) then I will refuse because that is CHEATING and a YELLOW CARD OFFENCE.  Also, if I work harder than I did in today's lesson then I will probably get further and I'll learn more = happy face.
