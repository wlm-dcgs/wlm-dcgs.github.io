IT Post for lesson on 15/01/2016

Today we looked at media and I found out that writing, paintings, adverts, drawings,  social media, and lots of other things are all media. We looked at an commercial for a kia, that showed hamsters who started off extremely fat, and got thinner and thinner as the commercial ad went on, going to the gym and jogging and stuff that.  They kept falling flat on their faces on the running machine and stuff like that, and people didn't laugh at them which I definitely would, especially if it was a hamster.  At the end they arrived in the advertised car and they came out wearing dark glasses and black suits and then they went into a building. That was the end of it.  We talked about the target audience, text and subtext, and untold stories in the ad.  Then we got set our homework.
