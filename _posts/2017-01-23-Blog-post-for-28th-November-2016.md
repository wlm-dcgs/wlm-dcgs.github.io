You had to think up something good to do, and as the pair next to us had one person missing, we used two robot arms instead of one.  Using a pencil and a USB memory stick cover, we controlled the arms so that one of them picked up the item (whichever one it was) and pass it to the other in midair.  This was done repeatedly during the video, and it helped me to control the robot arm better.  The youtube video link is here:

For one thing, we could NOT use more than one robot arm, so we could NOT and would NOT have a three way thing.  Also, as the person from the other pair could not do things so quickly,  he was slower than us.  I think I could have been a bit slower to suit him.

 I will do things to suit the other person if his pair is not here, and then I can work on making loads of other cool stuff happen, such as to draw something.
