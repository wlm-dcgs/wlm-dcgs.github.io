It is always a lot easier to learn something if you think about it and always read the instructions.  When I did this this week, things went a lot quicker than in previous weeks when I hadn't done so.  I still had to think things over though, and it says that I am still on 23% when I can’t be because of the fact that I completed at least 3 exercises.  

This is exactly the same as last week because I did almost exactly the same thing as last week and it still says 23%</td>

    <td>
If I remember all the meanings of things then I will understand what is happening a lot better and will be able to simply pass over that and not type it into google to find the definition.  The meaning of 'and’ is : _____ and _____ = true.  This says that two things are true, whereas ‘or’ and ‘not’ mean different things.  I need to work on remembering the meanings of these.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time?   How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I will read the instructions repeatedly and remember meanings of key words.  This will help me complete exercise faster and with more understanding.  I will also make sure that I know what things mean.
