**Computers: Viruses, internal parts and external parts**

**Peripherals** are devices on the outside of a computer that get information in and out of the computer.

**The hard drive **is a data storage disk used in old computers.  They contain one hard disk that rotates and is magnetic.

**An RAM** is another type of memory, standing for Random Access Memory.  When a computer lags when there are lots of tabs open, that is because the RAM is full.

**A CPU** is the Central Processing Unit where every command goes to be sent to the correct location.

**Malware** is a word made by combining 'malicious' and ‘software’.  A virus is a type of malware, but there are others such as spyware or trojan.

**Viruses** spread quickly, once you have got one on your computer, and basically stop programmes from working properly.  They can be anything between glitches in programmes and lost documents or applications.  All your documents could be lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The name virus probably comes from human viruses that also spread quickly.

**Worms** spread from device to device, copying themselves many, many times and can quickly harm a device.  They could copy themselves onto somebody's email, and then send copies to every one of your contacts.

**A trojan horse** or trojan is a program that behaves at first that it will be extremely good and useful, but then attacks and causes complete havoc in your computer.  The Greek myth of the Trojans wheeling a model horse up to the gates of Troy and then being taken in by the citizens of Troy with Trojans inside who then attacked is how it got the name.

**Zombienets / Botnets **

Bots are a very popular and very clever cybercrime that gives somebody the power to control a large number of computers.  Once a computer is in control of somebody else, it turns 'zombie' and so becomes a zombie computer.  A  zombie computer will then be part of a  zombie net / botnet which will create viruses, spam, and other types of malware.  The word ‘zombienet’ comes from the zombie computers which are called that because they cause damage and havoc on your computer.  Botnet comes from bot.
