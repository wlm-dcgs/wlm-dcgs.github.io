The arrival of about five people 20 minutes into the lesson probably meant that the time that there was for ske to explain was slightly more limited than it would have been.  I came on time and as the first bit was a really easy questionnaire that took no time at all and the rest of the lesson was ske talking, I'm not sure what limited learning and what habits need to be worked on apart from listening, which I did for the whole lesson anyway.

To improve, as we were told that it helps to put your hand up and answer something, I think that I should be putting my hand up more.  I am normally too shy to do it in the first place due to my stammer anyway, so to start doing it would definitely improve my learning.
