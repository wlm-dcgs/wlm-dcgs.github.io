To do it at all, you had to get the arm from FAK, so without telling him you could not do the work.  You had to plug in the robot arm to the FUZE box, and then use the code on it.  I think one thing that made us work faster was just the fact that there was a robot arm in the first place.  The arm has a moving arm, finger, elbow, and wrist.  To get it to work, you had to read the instructions in the manual.  I learnt how to fix my blog colour scheme by LISTENING, because about halfway through, FAK called the whole class over because apparently our blogs were going to be graded.

 Because part of it apparently needed lights, I was unsure what to do.  I asked whether or not to, and FAK produced a robot arm for us, which we then tried to control.  So we kept on doing it all lesson, but only remembered the manual part way through.  This was not very helpful at all, in any way.  As many people kept on talking during the blog grading explanation, time was limited as FAK had to keep repeating what he was saying to some people.  I at first could not remember how to change the colour scheme, but now I know.

I will set up incredibly quickly, so that I can have the maximum possible time to do the coding which I find quite fun anyway. I will try to get the coding correct, so that no time is wasted.  It would be even better if it was done correctly first time so that it gets done even more quickly, because then even more would get done.  The coding just needed to be checked this time, so not much time was wasted there, so I will have to get the robot arm quickly too.  I will make sure that I READ THE MANUAL.  I will at least try to change the blog colour scheme during the lesson, so that it looks nice, and then I can actually say that something in the lesson has worked.
