    <td>To make sure that the program actually works everything has to be copied exactly, so one of us (James Spicer and I) would basically read out the code,and the other would type everything onto the program coding system.  Then we would swap, and later swap again, saving our work to our memory sticks.  We always tried to do this  stuff quickly, so more could be done.</td>

    <td>If I had had much more time to do this, then I could have done much more work, but I can work on setting up devices quickly as a habit to work on for next lesson.  I could easily have done that much more quickly, and read the manual more quickly for James (though I do stammer) and so I would then have had much more time working on typing out code to then finally press F3 at the end to see what it did.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Setting up could definitely be done faster, so then there would be more time for typing out the code onto the device and the same goes for the end of the lesson when we are taking the stuff (FUZE box, cable for it, manual, monitor) back to the boxes where they are kept.  If we typed faster, that would mean more could get done, and the saving to memory sticks could be done more quickly, giving more time for work.  If I talk to my partner about what we are going to do, then it may get done faster.
