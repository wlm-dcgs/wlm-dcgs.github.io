My Virtual Shop

In this lesson, we made a virtual shop, with chosen objects.  As you can see, all mine are parts of a burger, such as mustard, bacon, and lettuce.  These were given prices, and using the function VLOOKUP, three columns to the right, I was able to make it so that I could choose from various parts of a burger.  It would then automatically show the price in the next column.  I then did the same thing with quantity, making it from 1-100, so that you could, if you wanted, have a burger with 100 buns, 100 burger patties, 100 lettuce leaves, etc etc etc.  MTA then showed us how we could make offers on the virtual shop so that it would do things like twenty per cent off for five or more than five items being purchased.
