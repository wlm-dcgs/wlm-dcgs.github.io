IT post for lesson on 22/01/2016

Today in IT we looked at another commercial ad showing a normal Mcdonalds burger compared to one of the ones shown on an ad.  The normal burger looked much flatter than the one on the ad, because the on the ad they wanted everything in the burger to be showing at the front, and they made the burger look fatter by cooking it on its side.  We talked about what was realistic and what was fantasy.  After that we were shown a slice of pizza being turned into a model, and then a woman being changed loads for the ad.
