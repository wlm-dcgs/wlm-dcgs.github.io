    <td>To do it at all, you had to get the arm from FAK, so without telling him you could not do the work.  You had to plug in the robot arm to the FUZE box, and then use the code on it.  I think one thing that made us work faster was just the fact that there was a robot arm in the first place.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Because part of it apparently needed lights, I was unsure what to do.  I asked whether or not to, and FAK produced a robot arm for us, which we then tried to control.  So we kept on doing it all lesson, and I think it worked.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will set up incredibly quickly, so that I can have the maximum possible time to do the coding which I find quite fun anyway. I will try to get the coding correct, so that no time is wasted.  It would be even better if it was done correctly first time so that it gets done even more quickly, because then even more would get done.  The coding just needed to be checked this time, so not much time was wasted there, so I will have to get the robot arm quickly too.
