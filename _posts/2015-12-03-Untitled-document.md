**What went well**

I managed to get everything done in time, and I got everything right without making any mistakes. I remembered to put github.io (unlike Zino) when it was needed and forgot nothing.   I was always really worried I was making the mistake that Mr Keen said was the thing that made everything go horribly wrong and that I would have to do everything again,but luckily that didn't happen. Overall, I thought it went extremely well.

**What didn't go so well**

Even though I did everything in time, I still took ages to do everything and sometimes needed help. However, that was about it.
