    <td>Repl.it is a coding program, and in using it today we were able to have a improve our calculator, which could do 4 functions - plus, minus, multiply, and divide.  Using a+b, a-b, a*b, and a/b, we could use the question 'What function would you like to use?' and then ’Enter your number’ twice, so you could get a basic calculation done.  This was done using .lower, main(), and several other functions.</td>

    <td>I’m not really sure why and I can’t remember why, but I simply could not get it to work properly and could not understand why.  I spent more than ½ an hour after school trying to work out how it worked, but failed.</td>

    <td>I think that I did basically what SKE showed us, but mine, a tiny bit different, didn’t work.  Next time I am determined to listen more, and make sure that it works properly, so I can make the most of what I have done in the lesson, creating a functioning code.</td>
