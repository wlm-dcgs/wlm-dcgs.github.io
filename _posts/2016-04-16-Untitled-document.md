**Blog Post for Easter Prezi Project, 15/04/2016**

Prezis can be amazing, with perfect grammar, awful, with about the worst grammar in the world and impossible to read, or somewhere in between with alright grammar.  If the grammar is not perfect, then the creator is lazy.  CAPITAL LETTERS are primary things, and so are full stops, commas, apostrophes and semicolons.  What also make prezis amazing are the layouts.  Mine is not that good compared to many, or I doubt it is.  It is just a circle with small circles.  Jeremiah had one which was much better, but he could have made it much closer in.  The other prezi that was shown in class was absolutely dreadful.
