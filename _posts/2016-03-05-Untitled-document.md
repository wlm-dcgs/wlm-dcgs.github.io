**Blog Post for lesson on 05/03/2016**

Today in IT we watched a video of two siblings in a race to 1,000,000 views on youtube.  The younger pair of people tried doing things like surprising people by hiding in dustbins, doing the cinnamon challenge,putting loads of plastic balls in people's lockers, scaring cyclists, getting the older sibling to recite nursery rhymes and other things that make people laugh, and the older people did extremely stupid things that could get you teased by everyone in the community and around the world.  Then one of the two younger children committed a crime known as child pawn by putting a video of the elder sibling having sex with his girlfriend who hadn’t wanted to be part of the competition anyway.  Then we were shown the children’s problems and worries, and then we went to science with Mrs Burnett.
