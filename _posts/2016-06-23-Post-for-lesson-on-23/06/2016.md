Post for lesson on 23/06/2016

Today we carried on with our game, and made the micro bit able to show random shapes.  Other things to do that we have not done are:

* Make the shapes able to rotate

* Make rows delete

* Make levels

* Make movement of shapes

This will be next week's lesson time, and this weekâ€™s homework.  I am learning a lot of new things, but I have once asked for help.  I am enjoying the micro bit game designing.  However, it is difficult.

Let's hope that next week we will still be in the EU.
