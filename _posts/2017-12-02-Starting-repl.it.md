    <td>Repl.it is a coding program, and in using it today we were able to have a conversation with the computer, asking questions such as "Are you good today?", “How old are you?”(I couldn't get this to work), “What’s your name?”, and “When’s your birthday?”.    I managed to get answers for them of yes/no/wrong answer(repeat question), <18/>18/other(repeat question), Jeremy Corbyn/Theresa May/wrong answer(repeat question)(this was a joke), and 22nd October(my birthday)/wrong answer</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I tried doing “How old are you?”, and found that it did not recognise < / >, so spent ages trying to work out what to do, and it still didn’t work.  This took a lot of time, so it was extremely annoying and time wasting.  I need to work on being able to remember the code that I learnt last year so that I can do more complicated stuff.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that having done basically what SKE showed us and copied it multiple times, changing words, I need to push myself a bit more, and attempt even more complicated things using repl.it to make more detailed and longer conversations with the computer.  I will also try and learn some more forms of code other than while, .lower(), .upper(), print and a few others.</td>
