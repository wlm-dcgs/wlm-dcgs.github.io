**What Went Well:**

I got everything done in time, and everything was correct. I changed the background and text colour, and I *think *it looks good, but for some reason I'm not completely sure. Nothing confused me, and I was never last up to the front.  Everything actually worked out pretty well and I am very pleased with how it went.

**Even Better If:**

It would have been better if I was a bit faster to get up to the front, and if I had got a background and text I liked and was completely sure about.
