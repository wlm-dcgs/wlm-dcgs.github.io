    <td>To get the program to actually work today, we had to read the booklet (manual) extremely carefully, and copy the text word for word.  The correct strategy was to make sure you didn't miss anything.  I learned that to get the text to show when you pressed F3 to run it, you had to put the word 'print'.  If this had not been done, then the text would not appear.</td>

    <td>If I had had more time to do the work with the FUZE boxes, then I would have been able to do more and learn more about what we were doing in class, but I still did stages 1 & 2, so I had done as much as we needed to do in the lesson.  However, I do still think that I should be reading the booklet more carefully, so that I can get it right first time and not have to look even more closely to work out what's happening with the code and why it isn't working sometimes.</td>

    <td>I think the best thing to do next lesson is to speed up a little bit, because then more can be done in the lessons to come.  If I talk to my group partner, I can work out what Iâ€™m getting wrong faster, or maybe just get nothing wrong at all throughout the entirety of the lesson.</td>
