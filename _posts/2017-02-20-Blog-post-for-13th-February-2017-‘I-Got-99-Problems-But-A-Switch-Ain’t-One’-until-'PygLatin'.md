Today I spent about 20 minutes lesson simply trying to get passed one stage by the name of 'I got 99 problems but a switch ain't one’.  However, having reread the questions more slowly and properly, I was then able to do it in about thirty seconds.  I then did a few more stages, reached PygLatin and worked on that for the last ten minutes.</td>

I did NOT read the instructions at the start of this lesson (BIG mistake).  As this meant I could not do it, I spent quite a long time just thinking about over-complicated things that would not make ‘I got 99 problems but a switch ain’t one’ work.</td>

I will read the instructions!</td>
