Post for IT lesson on 29/01/2016

Today in IT we talked about the advantages and disadvantages of social media.  

Advantages were:

* You can show photos to other people easily

* You can talk to people over a long distance

* It is a good way to keep up with people who you would otherwise have lost contact with

and others

Disadvantages were:

* You could be talking to a complete stranger

* You could break your neck

* People might see something in a different way and find it offensive

We were then given 12 sheets of paper with things you might post on social media on them, and were told to lay them out in order from good to bad.
