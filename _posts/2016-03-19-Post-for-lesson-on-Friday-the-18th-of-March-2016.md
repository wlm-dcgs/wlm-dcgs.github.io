**Post for lesson on Friday the 18th of March 2016**

Today in Information Technology we set up our Prezi accounts.  We put in all our details and made prezis. Mine was about the fez.  We were told that a rubbish presentation was saying:

Hello.  My name is Johnny and today I am going to talk about dogs.

 

This is my first dog.  It is a labrador.

This is my second dog.  It is a collie.

This is my third dog. It is an alsatian.

Our homework was to play around with Prezi.
