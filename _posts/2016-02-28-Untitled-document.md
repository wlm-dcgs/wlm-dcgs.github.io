**Blog Post for Media Navigator**

Creating my identity map was quite fun and a bit weird to be thinking of all these things that define me from everybody else in the world.  I felt fine about sharing it with other people in the class, but some people had identity maps that were much better than mine (Akash Sharma).  I thought that sometimes I was being rather mean, and at other times I wasn't being strict enough on the comments.  I don’t have any particular opinion about different types of commenting, but if I had to chose I would go with the anonymous commenting and not the comments that are face to face with the person who has done the work.  To me, there weren’t really any surprises in my comments. They were basically all 

* A bit more colour

* A bit more information

It felt a bit odd to have so many, but apart from that it was normal.  It is different from commenting online because I knew exactly who each person was and knew what they looked like as their names were on their pieces of work.  I think the identity map did tell you a little bit about how much I'm going to post in the future.  I don’t spend a huge amount of time staring at a screen, and probably won’t use it so much in the future.  No.  There are not any changes I want to make in the media I use based on this activity.  These six lessons changed how I view social media.  I used to think it was much better than it actually is and that you could talk much more easily.  The lessons did change how I plan on using social media in the future. I will probably use it less than I thought it would.
