**Virtual Shop Eat in Take Away**

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oycQ0WwpOmK6X4qHX0r1HrFmwbntu_uFq3ntJrPeTpM/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oycQ0WwpOmK6X4qHX0r1HrFmwbntu_uFq3ntJrPeTpM/edit#gid=0)

In this lesson, MTA was not here, so we simply continued with our Virtual Shops, making offers and various other things.  I decided to do an offer where you would get five percent off if you had your burger as a takeaway instead of eating in.  However, I found this very difficult, so spent almost the entire lesson doing it, and even then only partly got it to work, using the code =if(I3=D3, H15*0.95).  I worked this out in about twenty minutes, and then spent the remaining 35 minutes (we were a bit late to the lesson) trying, and failing to get it to work, as this first bit only worked for Take Away and not for Eat In.
