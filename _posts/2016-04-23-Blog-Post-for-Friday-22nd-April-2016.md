**Blog Post for Friday 22nd April 2016**

Micro bits can be used to create many things, from a simple way of rolling a dice, to things that are much more complex.  They do take time, but are interesting and you can get patterns like arrows, a heart, or a face if you want.   Even though a micro bit is a a small piece of kit, it can do some amazing stuff.  Mr  Keen should have had 180 in September, but he still has 0 micro bits.  ):  They are a complex work of art.
